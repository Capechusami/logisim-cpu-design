# logisim-cpu-design
A custom-built 8 bit CPU design created using Logisim for educational and experimental use.
# Logisim CPU Design

A complete CPU design built using [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) for educational purposes. This project simulates a simple custom processor architecture including registers, ALU, control unit, and memory components.

## ðŸ§  Features

- 4-bit MAR (Memory Address Register)
- 8-bit General Purpose Registers (A, B)
- ALU with basic operations (Add, Sub, AND, OR)
- Program Counter (PC)
- Instruction Register (IR)
- Control Unit with Microinstructions
- Data Bus and Address Bus separation
- Input/Output operations
- Step-by-step clock execution for instruction cycles

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Logisim (original or Logisim Evolution)
- Basic understanding of computer architecture

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open the `.circ` file in Logisim
2. Click the **"Simulate"** menu â†’ **"Ticks Enabled"**
3. Use the **clock button** to step through CPU instructions
4. Observe register values, buses, and control signals in real-time
